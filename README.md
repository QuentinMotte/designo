    In this exercise we have integrated the model of a figma design with the "pixel perfect" mentality.
    We started by making the parts in common with live share and then compartmentalizing the rest of the project as a sub-task that we then attributed to each of us.
    Communication was the key to this project.

## What we can improve for our projects

-   BEM methodology
-   Mixins
-   ...

</br>

## Instructions

&#9745; Observe the design carefully, you need to follow it strictly!

&#9745; The website has to be responsive.

&#9745; To help you to set up a naming convention for your classes in CSS we recommend to use the BEM methodology.

&#9745; The website has to respond to the w3c validator.

&#9745; Pay attention to your SEO (The Lighthouse extension can help you).

&#9745; You must use Sass.

&#9745; Think about some nice CSS effects/animations.

&#9745; Make sure the site is BUG FREE.

&#9745; Respect the deadline.

&#9745; Everyone in the team must code.

</br>

### For GitHub

&#9745; Write a good README

&#9745; Mention a description and the website URL on the top of the repository

</br>

### Bonus

&#9745; Use a scroll to top button at the right bottom of the pages.

&#9745; In tablet and mobile mode, there must be a functional hamburger menu.

&#9745; Hide the menu when scroll down in the page and display it when scroll up. Take example on this website

&#9744; Use a slighty parallax effect for some images (Example).

</br>

-   favicon
-   link home on logo
-   intermidiate media querry
-   link in About and Contact pages target specific section on Locations page
